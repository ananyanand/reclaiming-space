Java program that includes the functionality to pack, unpack, search, and modify records in files with deleted records saved in a separate region. It also checks the size of the new record and appends it if the size is not the same as the deleted record
  This updated program includes the additional functionality of deleting records. When a record is deleted, its position and size are saved in a separate file called "deleted_records.txt". When packing a new record, the program first checks if there are any deleted records in the "deleted_records.txt" file. If a deleted record with the same size is found, the new record is packed in that position. If no deleted records with the same size are found, the new record is appended to the end of the file.
